# 4-Bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) Design and Layout

This project encompasses the design and implementation of a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) capable of performing addition, subtraction, comparison, and bitwise AND operations. The project progresses through several stages, starting with Verilog implementation, followed by layout design using the Magic layout tool, and culminating in delay analysis to estimate critical paths and maximum delay in the circuit. Additionally, NGSpice is utilized as a simulation tool to validate the Verilog design and assess its performance characteristics.

## Verilog Implementation
The ALU functionality is initially implemented in Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language). This involves coding the logic for addition, subtraction, comparison, and ANDing operations on 4-bit inputs. Testbenches are created to verify the correctness and functionality of the ALU design.

## Layout Design in Magic
Following the Verilog implementation, the full ALU layout is designed using the Magic layout tool. Standard cells are placed and interconnected according to the logic defined in Verilog. The layout design encompasses the arrangement of individual cells, routing of signals, and placement of inputs and outputs.


## NGSpice Simulation and Analysis
NGSpice is employed as a simulation tool to validate the Verilog design and assess its performance characteristics. Simulation results obtained from NGSpice help verify the functionality of the ALU design and provide insights into its timing behavior, enabling further optimization if required.


## Delay Analysis and Critical Path Identification
Upon completion of layout design, delay analysis is conducted to estimate the critical path and maximum delay in the circuit. Critical paths, representing the longest propagation delay through the ALU, are identified and analyzed to optimize performance and ensure proper functionality.
